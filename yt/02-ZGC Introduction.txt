- Performance
- How to get started?


##############
# What is ZGC
##############
- a scalable low latency garbage collector available from JDK11

- 10ms = Max GC pause time
- TB = multi-terabyte heaps

- Concurrent
Marking
Relocation / Compaction
Relocation Set Selection
Reference Processing
JNI WeakRefs Cleaning
StringTable Cleaning

- Single generation
- Load barriers
- Colored pointers
- Region-based
- Partial Compaction
- NUMA-ware

- ZGC pause times do NOT increase with heap or live-set sizes


##############
# ZGC Phases
##############
- GC Cycle:

Pause Mark Start => (Concurrent Mark / Remap) => Pause Mark End => (Concurrent Prepare for Reloc.) => Pause Relocate Start => (Concurrent Relocate)

- Pause Mark Start = Scan thread stacks and get Object pointers root reference
- Concurrent Mark / Remap = concurrently walk through Object graphs and mark live objects
- Pause Mark End = Synchronization point where all the live objects and dead objects are known
- Concurrent Prepare for Reloc. = Reference processing (Soft, weak, phantom), weak root cleaning and relocation set selection (heap memory which needs compaction)
- Pause Relocate Start = Scan thread stacks and gets memory roots to start compaction
- Concurrent Relocate = concurrently compact heap (the most heavy process)

- the 3 pauses are less than 10ms each


##############
# Performance
##############
- performance is much better than G1 and parallel collectors


######################
# How to get started
######################
- VM argument: -XX:+UseZGC
- extra: -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC

- Tuning options: -Xmx<size> -XX:ConcGCThreads=<number>
- Logging: -Xlog:gc (basic); -Xlog:gc* (detailed)

- only supported on Linux OS


##########
# Summary
##########
- Low latency
ZGC pause times stay below 10ms

- Scalable
ZGC pause times do NOT increase with the heap or live-set size

- Easy to Tune
Just set the heap size
